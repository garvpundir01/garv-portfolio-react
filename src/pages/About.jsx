      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Garv Pundir, a builder, thinker, and collaborator. At UW–Madison, I’ve worked on everything from grading AI models to predicting stock prices and creating IoT interfaces — all with a focus on impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy teaching (as a CS peer mentor), tinkering with backend logic, and combining data with design to deliver seamless user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I’m curious about music, sustainability, and creative storytelling. Whether it’s debugging C or mentoring classmates, I love learning and growing with people.
