          <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Garv Pundir</h1>

          <p>
            I'm <strong>Garv Pundir</strong>, a junior at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong>, and <strong>Economics</strong>. Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems by building intelligent systems, designing scalable software, and delivering clean user experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic journey is driven by curiosity and a strong foundation in programming, systems, and data modeling. Iâ€™ve applied machine learning to stock price forecasting, built LSTM models for time-series prediction, and explored AI alignment by training LLMs to assess student writing. Iâ€™ve also developed interactive frontends for IoT systems and contributed to a research-backed project comparing ChatGPT to domain-specific scientific datasets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside the classroom, Iâ€™m a <strong>CS354 Peer Mentor</strong>, helping students understand memory management, assembly language, and C programming. I enjoy mentoring, collaborating on open-source projects, and working at the intersection of backend development and data analysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute to impactful projects, learn from sharp people, and make tech more thoughtful and human-centered.
